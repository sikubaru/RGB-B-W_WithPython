1. First, we should install some packages on the command prompt.

pip install numpy
pip install imageio
pip install opencv-python
pip install scipy

2. Select the photo and save the photo in directory c. I make folder “Sketch” on directory C and put the picture there.

3. After that, copy the syntax below on text editor and save the syntax on the same folder with the picture with the “py” format. I’m using sublime text.

import numpy as np
import imageio
import scipy.ndimage
import cv2
img="your file picture.jpg"
def grayscale(rgb):
 return np.dot(rgb[...,:3],[0.999,0.001,0.002])
def  dodge(front,back):
  result=front*100/(255-back)
  result[result>255]=255
  result[back==255]=255
  return result.astype('uint8')
s=imageio.imread(img)
g=grayscale(s)
i=255-g
b=scipy.ndimage.filters.gaussian_filter(i,sigma=120)
r=dodge(b,g)
cv2.imwrite('your file picture_sketch.jpg',r)

4. After that, copy the syntax below on your command prompt.

cd (your folder name)..
(your folder name)>python (your syntax name).py 

5.The picture will be automatically stored in the folder that was created before. 

6. ENJOY IT
